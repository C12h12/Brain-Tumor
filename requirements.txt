# Data Handling & Processing:

# Pandas – Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially working with tabular data (CSV, Excel, SQL, etc.).
# NumPy – Provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions.
# PyYAML – Used for reading and writing YAML files, often for configuration management.

# Machine Learning & Deep Learning:

# Scikit-learn – A library for traditional ML algorithms (classification, regression, clustering, etc.), along with tools for preprocessing and model evaluation.
# Keras – A high-level deep learning API that runs on top of TensorFlow, simplifying model creation.
# TensorFlow – An end-to-end deep learning framework for training and deploying models.
# Keras Preprocessing – A package for preprocessing image, text, and sequence data for deep learning models.

# Model Management & Tracking:

# Joblib – Used for saving and loading large NumPy arrays and machine learning models efficiently.
# h5py – A library for handling HDF5 files, often used to save Keras models.
# MLflow – A platform for tracking, packaging, and deploying ML models.
# DVC (Data Version Control) – A version control system for ML projects, similar to Git but designed for handling large datasets and models.

# Visualization:

# Matplotlib – A fundamental plotting library for visualizing data through graphs and charts.
# Seaborn – Built on top of Matplotlib, provides advanced statistical visualizations.

# Computer Vision & Deployment:

# OpenCV (opencv-python) – A library for image and video processing, widely used in computer vision tasks.
# Streamlit – A Python framework for building interactive web applications, often used to deploy ML models with a user-friendly interface.
